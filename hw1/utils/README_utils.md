This directory contains matlab functions for Bloch Simulations, most of which were downloaded from Brian Hargreaves' Bloch Equation Simulation webpage (http://mrsrl.stanford.edu/~brian/bloch/). The functions downloaded from this webpage are marked in their headers with a note referencing the Original Author (Brian Hargreaves) and containing the link to the webpage they were downloaded from.

Several of the functions are slightly edited versions on Dr. Hargreaves' code and wrappers to call to functions from Dr. Hargreaves online code. 

Make sure to add this directory to your matlab search path in order to run the matlab scripts for the HW problems (located in hw1/scripts). This can be done using:

addpath('/path/to/hw1/utils');
