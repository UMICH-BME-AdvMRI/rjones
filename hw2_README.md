# Info on HW2 submission

See hw2/README.txt for additional info.

Matlab code and formal/written report for HW2 can be found in /hw2.

## Reference for Bloch Equation Simulation code
Many of the Bloch Sim matlab functions were downloaded from Brian Hargreaves' Bloch Equation Simulation webpage (http://mrsrl.stanford.edu/~brian/bloch/). The Matlab functions downloaded from this webpage have a note in the function header and a link to the webpage. 

The scripts used to run each problem/part/subpart were made by me, but they are largely just wrappers that call the functions downloaded from the Bloch Equation Simulation webpage. 

## Report
The written responses to problems can be found in /hw2/hw2-report-rj.pdf, which contains responses to problems 1 & 2.

## Matlab code
First, in order to run the code and reproduce results, be sure to add the paths to /hw2, /hw2/blochsim_utils and /hw2/epg_funcs to the Matlab search path. This can be done using: 

addpath(genpath('/path/to/hw2'));
-or-
addpath('/path/to/hw2');
addpath('/path/to/hw2/blochsim_utils');
addpath('/path/to/hw2/epg_funcs');

 - There are Matlab scripts for each problem located in /hw2. These scripts contain code to run each part of the respective problem, in order. 

## Plots + Figures
Plots and figures can be found in the directories /hw2/plots_p1 and /hw2/plots_p2. These files were generated by the matlab scripts, and used in the formal written report.
