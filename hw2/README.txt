####################################################################################

Please note that the functions/utilities used to run BlochSim and EPG simulations were largely based off of Stanford matlab toolboxes (Author: Brian Hargreaves) available online. Some functions have been modified to adapt to the homework problems. In particular, for this homework, the following functions were modified:

--- /blochsim_utils ---
sesignal.m, fsesignal.m [fsesignal_multi.m, for multiple TRs]

--- /epg_funcs ---
epg_cpmg.m [epg_cpmg_multi_tr.m, for multiple TRs]
