README - HW2 CODE 

Please note that the functions/utilities to run BlochSim and EPG simulations were largely based off of Stanford matlab toolboxes (Author: Brian Hargreaves) available online. Some functions have been modified to adapt to the homework problems. In particular, for this homework, the following functions were modified:

sesignal.m, fsesignal.m [fsesignal_multi.m, for multiple TRs]
epg_cpmg.m [epg_cpmg_multi_tr.m, for multiple TRs]

The original code can be found at the following weblinks (via Brian Hargreaves):
