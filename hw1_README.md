# Info on HW1 submission

Matlab code and formal/written report for HW1 can be found in /hw1.

## Report
The written responses to problems can be found in /hw1/hw1-report. The directory contains 2 PDF files, one with responses to problems 1 and 2, and the other with responses for problem 3.

## Matlab code
First, in order to run the code and reproduce results, be sure to add the paths to /hw1/scripts and /hw1/utils to the Matlab search path. This can be done using: 

addpath(genpath('/path/to/hw1'));
or
addpath('/path/to/hw1/utils');
addpath('/path/to/hw1/scripts');

 - There are Matlab scripts for each part of each problem located in /hw1/scripts
 - There are Bloch Sim utilities located in /hw1/utils. **These functions are required to run the problem/part scripts!** Thus you must make sure the /utils dir is in hte matlab search path before running the scripts.

## Plots + Figures
Plots and figures can be found in the directory /hw1/plots. These files were generated by the matlab scripts, and used in the formal written report.
