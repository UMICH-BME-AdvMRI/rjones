# Info on HW3 submission

See hw3/README.txt for additional info.

Matlab code and formal/written report for HW3 can be found in /hw3.

## Report
The written responses to problems can be found in /hw3/hw3-report-rj.pdf, which contains responses to problems 1 & 2.

## Matlab code
The code for problem 1 is in the file script_p1_rj.m, and the code for problem 2 is in the file script_p2_rj.m. 
A few additional matlab functions (.m files) are included in /hw3, and are called by the script_p*_rj.m codes. 

## Plots + Figures
Plots and figures have been included in the report PDF. They can also be generated by the script_p*_rj.m files mentioned above (you probably need to change the "figdir" variable to the dir/path you want the files saved to).
